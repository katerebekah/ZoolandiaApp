# Zoolandia App

## Project Summary
Congratulations, your development team has a client and your client needs you to build them an app. Your client is Zoolandia, the local zoo. They gave you a list of requirements in a Trello project. It is the job of your development team to finish the project.

[Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/GDb7POlI/zoolandia-app) : This Trello Board holds the tickets with the business needs for the application. The tickets are in priority order, and some of the final tickets are marked as Challenges and aren't required for your client to accept your app as complete. 
NOTE: You should copy this board and not try to edit it.

Because you are still learning, you should approach the app in three steps: Data Access Layer, APIs, and UI. 

#### Team Meetings
Each "sprint" will have two meetings, planning and retro. Planning is where you decide what tickets you will be committing to finishing before the end of the sprint. If you need to change anything that was decided during a sprint planning meeting, you need full team approval (team meeting is encouraged but not required for that). A sprint retro is a meeting at the end of the sprint where you discuss what went well and what can be improved in a sprint. This can also include a code review.

A sprint for you will be no more than one week long. Bi-weekly meetings will enable you more flexibility, but are not required.

#### Code Review
All code must be approved by all members of your team before it can be merged into the code base. Make an effort to leave constructive notes and questions in pull requests. Never allow code you don't understand into the code base. For tricky code or for better understanding, hold group Code Review meetings where you discuss your code and allow others to give you input and ask questions.

## Step 1 : Implement Data Access Layer 

 1. Using business needs for the app, create an ERD.
 2. Create the data access layer for Zoolandia
 3. Create the repository that fulfills the business needs for the application

## Step 2 : Implement APIs

1. Create RESTful APIs for Zoolandia for that provide access to the functionality in the repository.

## Step 3 : Implement UI

1. Based on the APIs for the project and the business requirements, implement a UI for Zoolandia


#### Project Acceptance Criteria

1. All the non-Challenge tickets should be complete from the UI.
2. A Zoolandia business owner (your instructors/TAs) needs to accept each of the tickets and mark the card in Trello as Accepted.
3. Challenge: host this project and add it to your portfolio.
